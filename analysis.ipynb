    "# US Personal Medical Insurance - Regional Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the [README](./README.md), the goal of this project quantify the impact of regional factors on insurance charges and to identify if certain regions are more prone to higher charges and why. As such, I have identified 3 different analyses that will help me achieve this goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Descriptive Statistics - This will help to identify the differences of insurances costs between regions.\n",
    "2. Correlation Analysis - This will help to understand the correlation between other variables and their effect on insurance charges between each region.\n",
    "3. Comparative Analyses of Variables - To identify differences of variables between each region, which may be impacting charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, however, I must import and prepare the dataset."
